/**
 * The four HOME screens, mounted on their own.
 *
 * `characterisation.test.jsx` and `session-store.test.jsx` already drive all of this
 * through the whole app, and they are the tests that say HOME still works. What they
 * cannot say is whether a screen is INDEPENDENT of the shell: every one of them
 * renders EcuLab, so a screen that had quietly kept reading a value the shell passes
 * down would look identical from there.
 *
 * These mount each screen with nothing but a store around it. A screen that needs the
 * shell to render fails here and only here — which is the property the split exists to
 * create, and the one a later extraction is most likely to erode.
