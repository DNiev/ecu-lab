 * Real OEM binaries (BMW MSD80, Siemens Simos 18.1) are not publicly available in a
 * form this project can source or ship. These calibrations are RECONSTRUCTIONS built
 * from what is public — factory boost, compression, published power and torque peaks
 * and typical OEM wide-open-throttle lambda — and then validated against the real

 *
 * The tables are generated from the physics rather than hand-authored, so a
 * coefficient change can never leave a stale calibration behind.
