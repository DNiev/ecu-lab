 *
 * THREE RULES GOVERN THIS FUNCTION, and each one exists because breaking it produced a
 * false alarm on the app's own factory calibration — the fastest way to teach a player
 * that the advisor is noise.
 *
 * 1. EVERY CELL IS JUDGED AT ITS OWN ROW PRESSURE. A spark table is indexed by manifold
 *    pressure, so the 100 kPa row IS the calibration for 100 kPa. What the throttle
 *    happens to be doing when the engine passes through that row is not a property of
 *    the cell, and `factoryCalibration` writes it the same way. Solving the induction
 *    system first and judging at the pressure it produced meant reading the Golf R's
 *    100 kPa row at 200 kPa.
 *
 * 2. ONLY CELLS THE ENGINE CAN REACH, AT THE SPEED IT REACHES THEM. A turbo build never
 *    sees 200 kPa at 800 RPM. Judging it there reported the factory table as detonating
 *    at an operating point that cannot exist.
 *
 * 3. MIXTURE IS JUDGED ON WHAT WAS DELIVERED, NOT WHAT WAS COMMANDED, and the suggestion
 *    is the commanded number that would deliver the target — because that is what the
 *    player types into the cell. The two differ whenever the ECU's fuel maths is off, and
 *    a real factory table is written PRE-CORRECTED for its own MAF error: the Golf R
 *    commands 11.22 at 5000 RPM and full boost and delivers 12.20, its best-power target
 *    to the hundredth.

  // read the table at row pressures. It asks for whatever manifold pressure the boost
  // curve produced and gets a blend of two rows, and the knock ceiling between them falls
  // faster than the blend does — so a player could follow every suggestion here exactly
  // and still meet knock on the dyno, at pressures no row sits on. That was #43.
  //
  // Judging is one thing and advising is another, so only the advice changes. Between two
  // rows the value handed back is a blend, and the blend has to clear the ceiling at the
  // pressure it is handed back AT. At a fraction f of the way from this row up to the one
  // above:
  //
  //     (1 - f) * T_here + f * T_above  <=  ceiling(p_f)
  //     T_here <= (ceiling(p_f) - f * T_above) / (1 - f)
  //
  // Sampled at three points across the gap rather than only the middle, because the
  // ceiling is not linear in pressure and the binding point is not always halfway.
  //
  // Rows are walked from the most boosted downward, so the higher-pressure row — already
  // pinned to its own tighter ceiling — is fixed by the time its neighbour is solved, and
  // any excess comes out of the lower-pressure cell. That is the correct one to charge:
  // it is the cell reaching its extra advance up into pressure it does not have to carry.
  //
  // Rounded DOWN to the half degree, never to nearest. Rounding a safety limit up is how
  // you hand someone advice that is 0.2 deg past the thing you just told them not to
  // cross. And it only ever lowers a suggestion, so it cannot make advice more aggressive
