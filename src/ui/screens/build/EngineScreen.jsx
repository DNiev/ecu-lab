        </div>
      )}
      <ExpandableInfo title="Why changing hardware does not update your VE table">
        Everything that physically changes how this engine breathes feeds volumetric efficiency: bore/stroke ratio, cylinder count, compression, cam duration, valve springs, head material, intake/headers/exhaust, pipe diameter, turbine backpressure, even fuel choice (E85 evaporates cold enough to measurably densify the charge).
        <br /><br />But your VE table is a <b className={styles.em}>log</b> — a record of what the engine actually flowed last time it was measured. Bolt on a cam and that log does not rewrite itself; it just becomes wrong. In a real shop you would go back to the dyno and re-log airflow before trusting any of it.
        <br /><br />So this app never edits it silently. It tells you the table no longer matches the hardware; the logs tell you by how much, cell by cell, the way a tuner finds out — and you apply the correction once you understand why it moved.
        <br /><br />Note that <b className={styles.em}>boost is not part of VE</b>. VE measures how well the cylinder fills relative to the pressure available; boost raises that pressure (MAP) separately. That is why adding boost does not change these numbers, but adding a turbine does — the turbine is a restriction in the exhaust.

      <ExpandableInfo title="Why cylinder count and layout matter">
        For the same total displacement, spreading it across more, smaller cylinders means a shorter flame path in each, so the burn finishes sooner and the end gas has less time to knock — a small real knock-margin benefit — and more, smaller firing pulses smooth the delivery. More cylinders also means more bearings and friction, so it is a trade-off, not a free upgrade.

      <ExpandableInfo title="Bore, stroke, and engine character">
        Bore is cylinder diameter, stroke is how far the piston travels; together with cylinder count they set displacement. But the ratio between them shapes character independent of displacement: big-bore/short-stroke ("oversquare") tends to breathe and rev higher; small-bore/long-stroke ("undersquare") tends toward stronger low-end torque. This sandbox shifts your VE curve's effective bias toward high or low RPM based on what you set here.

      <input type="range" min={8.5} max={13.0} step={0.1} value={engineConfig.compression} onChange={(e) => setCfg({ compression: Number(e.target.value) })} className={styles.slider} />
      <ExpandableInfo title="Compression ratio's trade-off">
        Higher compression squeezes the mixture tighter before ignition, extracting more work from the same fuel — genuinely more efficient and torquey. The same squeeze also raises end-gas temperature and pressure, which is what causes knock. That is exactly why turbocharged engines usually run lower static compression than naturally aspirated ones: boost already adds cylinder pressure on its own.

        <span>mild · low-end torque</span><span>wild · top-end power</span>
      </div>
      <ExpandableInfo title="What camshaft duration actually does">
        Duration is how long, in crank degrees, a valve stays open. Hold the intake valve open longer and at <b className={styles.em}>low RPM</b> some charge gets pushed back out during compression — you lose bottom end. But at <b className={styles.em}>high RPM</b> there is barely time to fill the cylinder at all, and that extra open time is exactly what keeps it breathing.
        <br /><br />So a bigger cam does not add power everywhere — it <i>moves</i> the power. Watch the VE table and the dyno curve: the peak slides up the RPM range and the low-RPM cells drop. This sandbox models it by sampling the breathing curve at a cam-shifted engine speed, which is the honest way to represent it.
        <br /><br /><b className={styles.em}>Overlap</b> is the window where both valves are open together. It grows with duration, and it is why cammed engines idle lumpy, pull weak manifold vacuum, and sound the way they do.

      )}
      <ExpandableInfo title="Why springs decide how far a cam can go">
        The cam pushes the valve open; only the spring closes it. As RPM rises the valve has less and less time to follow the closing ramp, and past the spring's limit it stops following the lobe entirely — <b className={styles.em}>valve float</b>. The cylinder cannot fill, and power falls off a cliff rather than tapering.
        <br /><br />Bigger cams open valves further and faster, so they need stiffer springs. That is why "cam and springs" are sold together: fit an aggressive cam on stock springs and you will make <i>less</i> power than stock up top, because you float before you reach the RPM the cam was designed for.
        <br /><br />Stiffness is not free either — every cycle the engine compresses those springs, and that parasitic loss shows up in FMEP. Over-spring a mild cam and you simply lose a little power for nothing.

      <ExpandableInfo title="What a cam phaser does — and what it does not">
        A phaser turns the camshaft against the crank with oil pressure, moving every event on that cam by the same angle. It does not change the lobe: duration and lift are the grind's. What it changes is <i>when</i> — and that is enough to move the torque curve, because the intake valve closing is what decides how much charge is trapped.
        <br /><br />Advance the intake and it closes earlier: at low speed the charge has no momentum to keep filling after bottom dead centre, so closing early traps more of it; at high speed it cuts the ramming short. Every move also changes overlap, and overlap decides how much burned gas stays in the cylinder. The targets live on <b className={styles.em}>TUNE › VVT</b>; parked at zero, a phased engine is exactly the fixed-cam one.

      <ExpandableInfo title="Why boosted engines close the plug gap">
        Before a spark can do anything, the gap has to break down — and the voltage that takes rises with the density of the gas across it. Boost and advance both mean denser gas at the plug when it fires. Past what the coil can make, some events never light: a misfire that feels like a stutter and costs power exactly where the engine is working hardest. A smaller gap, a longer dwell or a stronger coil all buy it back.

      <ExpandableInfo title="Why block and head material matter">
        Aluminum conducts heat roughly three times faster than cast iron, so an aluminum head pulls heat away from the combustion chamber faster — a real, measurable knock-margin benefit. Cast iron is heavier and a worse conductor, but stiffer under heat, which is part of why some high-output blocks still use it.
